 /*
A Memory Leak is what we call memory which has not been properly deallocated by a program, which can never be used
again until the operating system steps in and reclaims it. Your program could end up running out of memory to use, slow down, or crash.

Instructions:
You only need to #include the file for it to work; you do not need to instantiate any MemLeakDetector objects (you'd just get duplicate reporting anyway).
#include this file, then run in Debug mode (Just F5, NOT Ctrl + F5, or click the play button (Local Windows Debugger above), or go to Debug->Start Debugging)
Let the program run to conclusion and close.
Then, look at your Output window, NOT the 'Error List'. Go to View->Output or press Alt + 2 to find it.
Scroll up or make it bigger and IF you have memory leaks they will appear like:

Detected memory leaks!

Object dump complete.

Notice the last one shows which line the 'new' was called that wasn't properly deleted.

The goal is to get rid of all those, so it just won't show anything.

You will also see things like:

'DataStructures.exe' (Win32): Loaded 'C:\Windows\System32\rpcrt4.dll'. Cannot find or open the PDB file.
The thread 0x3a14 has exited with code 0 (0x0).

These are all normal and can be ignored.

Please note this probably won't work on Mac or Linux, Sorry! find similar tools here:
Mac: https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev022f987b
Linux: http://valgrind.org/

Feel free to use this in any C++ program you make (you probably should!)
